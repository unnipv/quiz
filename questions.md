3.In 1863, at the advice of her stepdaughter and son, she moved to England, moving with her son James in London. She later relocated to St.Mary's Terrace, Hastings, East Sussex. She was surprised by her son's "flamboyant Bohemian lifestyle", however she tolerated it, and befriended some of his friends as well. According to a letter from her, one day, after a model failed to appear, her son (who was a prominent painter at that time) turned to her and suggested that he do her potrait. And so he did and named the painting "Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1". How do we better know this painting ?

4.It is the practice of looking through the contents of your refrigerator to see what raw ingredients you can easily lay your hands on, and using those words as a basis for a Google search term (which usually also incorporates the word 'recipe' somewhere) in order to get a list of suggestions of what to cook. Though it has only been in use for the last couple of years or so, this expression is thought to have been coined in 2002 by Bostonian blogger Judy Hourihan, a former Massachusetts software engineer.

6.The rhyme has often been associated with the Great Plague which happened in England in 1665, or with earlier outbreaks of the Black Death in England. Interpreteore the Second World War make no mention of this by 1951, however, it seems to have become well established as an explanation rs of the rhyme beffor the form of the rhyme that had become standard in the United Kingdom. Peter and Iona Opie, the leading authorities on nursery rhymes, remarked: The invariable sneezing and falling down in modern English versions have given would- be origin finders the opportunity to say that the rhyme dates back to the Great Plague. Sneezing or coughing was a final fatal symptom, and "all fall down" was exactly what happened. Which Rhyme ?

8.ID X X graduated from Oregon with a degree in journalism in 1959. He enlisted in the army for a year (and served in the reserves for seven), then enrolled at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford. As a kid and in college, X was involved in many sports like track running, basketball and football. Stanford changed X's life. For the first time, he was excited to read about something other than sports. And it was in Frank Shallenberger's small-business class that X conceived Y. Shallenberger gave the class the following assignment: Invent a New business, describe its purpose and create a marketing plan. The main thrust of X’s business plan was using cheap foreign labour to manufacture the products on a large scale. His inspiration behind so was the collapse of German cameras in the American market with the introduction of the cheaper Japanese Cameras. X later described that class as an 'aha!' moment.

9.Construction of X occurred in three stages across 199 years. Work on X began on August 14, 1173, during a period of military success and prosperity. X was finally completed in 1372. There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the X. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno ______. However, recent studies seem to indicate Diotisalvi as the original architect due to the time of construction. However, Diotisalvi usually signed his work and there is no signature on X, leading to speculation. During World War II, the Allies discovered that the Germans were using the X as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the X and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.

10.X aficionados often claim that the spread of its popularity is due to Pope Clement VIII's influence. Being pressured by his advisers to declare X the "______ invention of Satan" because of its popularity among Muslims and it being a sort of antithesis or substitute for ____ (which was used in the Eucharist), upon tasting it he instead declared that, "This devil's drink is so delicious...we should cheat the devil by baptizing it." The year often cited is 1600.

11.The name X, along with Y were regularly invoked in English legal instruments to satisfy technical requirements governing standing and jurisdiction, beginning perhaps as early as the reign of England's King Edward III (1312–1377).[5]

The Oxford English Dictionary states that X is "the name given to the fictitious lessee of the plaintiff, in the (now obsolete in the UK) mixed action of ejectment, the fictitious defendant being called Y.
This particular use became obsolete in the UK in 1852:
As is well known, the device of involving real people as notional lessees and ejectors was used to enable freeholders to sue the real ejectors. These were then replaced by the fictional characters X and Y. Eventually the medieval remedies were (mostly) abolished by the Real Property Limitation Act of 1833; the fictional characters of X and Y by the Common Law Procedure Act 1852; and the forms of action themselves by the Judicature Acts 1873-75."

The term 'X Injunction' (or X Order) is used in the UK to describe an injunction sought against someone whose identity is not known at the time it is issued:
"8.02 If an unknown person has possession of the confidential personal information and is threatening to disclose it, a X injunction may be sought against that person. The first time this form of injunction was used since 1852 in the United Kingdom was in 2005 when lawyers acting for JK Rowling and her publishers obtained an interim order against an unidentified person who had offered to sell chapters of a stolen copy of an unpublished Harry Potter novel to the media"
There are hundreds of variants and extended analogies of X, in different countries 
and legal systems and popular culture. What?

There is a history about an India temple in Kashi Vihswanath which contains a large room with three time-worn posts in it surrounded by 64 golden disks. Brahmin priests, acting out the command of an ancient prophecy, have been moving these disks, in accordance with the immutable rules of the Brahma, since that time. According to the legend, when the last move of the puzzle will be completed, the world will end.
If the legend were true, and if the priests were able to move disks at a rate of one per second, using the smallest number of moves, it would take them 264−1 seconds or roughly 585 billion years or 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 turns to finish, or about 45 times the life span of the sun.
There are many variations on this legend. For instance, in some tellings, the temple is a monastery and the priests are monks. The temple or monastery may be said to be in different parts of the world — including X, and may be associated with any religion. In some versions, other elements are introduced.

16.Lyrics of what ?

A girl who is warm and humanly during the day
A classy girl who knows how to enjoy the freedom of a cup of coffee
A girl whose heart gets hotter when night comes
A girl with that kind of twist
I’m a guy
A guy who is as warm as you during the day
A guy who one-shots his coffee before it even cools down
A guy whose heart bursts when night comes
That kind of guy
Beautiful, loveable
Yes you, hey, yes you, hey
Beautiful, loveable
Yes you, hey, yes you, hey
Now let’s go until the end

17.The first name X is an alternate form of the name Pink. Pink is a very rare first name among men, but its form X, not so much. X is apparently a latin variant for pink meaning noble or patrician.
The last name Y is considered to be the feminine equivalent of another name(say A).
So the first person is called XY and the second  is referred to as BA. Considering feminine to be gentler than masculine, pink is gentler than or a softer version of B. The same can be said of the two people as a whole. 
This is just one of the analogies that looks to give support to the theory that XY and BA are the same person, that has found huge support among fans.

18.First created by the UK Government during the onset of WWII,  it's sole intention was to boost the morale of the nation in light of the invasions. Due to it's limited distribution, it was little known until 2000, when a number of private companies started using it(or variants) for advertising/publicizing their products. It has created numerous other product ranges including parodies. Its message has also been felt relevant to the recent recession and has been adopted as an unofficial motto by many organisations. Since its copyright expired after 50 years, it is can be used by anyone publicly thus increasing its popularity.

It is the last version in a series of three. The first one is titled "Freedon Is In Peril. Defend It With All Your Might." while the second one is called "Your Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution Will Bring Us Victory".

21.X died of pneumonia in 1910 at a train station, after falling ill when he left home in the middle of winter. His death came only days after gathering the nerve to abandon his family and wealth and take up the path of a wandering ascetic, a path that he had agonized over pursuing for decades. He had not been at the peak of health before leaving home; his wife and daughters were all actively engaged in caring for him daily. He had been speaking and writing of his own death in the days preceding his departure from home, but fell ill at the station not far from home.

The police tried to limit access to his funeral procession, but thousands of peasants lined the streets at his funeral. Still, some peasants were heard to say that, other than knowing that "some nobleman had died," they knew little else about X himself.
