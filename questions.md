3. In 1863, at the advice of her stepdaughter and son, she moved to England, moving with her son James in London. She later relocated to St.Mary's Terrace, Hastings, East Sussex. She was surprised by her son's "flamboyant Bohemian lifestyle", however she tolerated it, and befriended some of his friends as well. According to a letter from her, one day, after a model failed to appear, her son (who was a prominent painter at that time) turned to her and suggested that he do her potrait. And so he did and named the painting "Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1". How do we better know this painting ?
